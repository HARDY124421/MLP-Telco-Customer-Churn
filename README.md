# 📉 Telco Customer Churn Prediction (MLP Project)

Welcome to my Machine Learning Project for predicting customer churn using the popular **Telco Customer Churn dataset**. This repository contains:

- ✅ A full data science pipeline (EDA → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation)
- 🎯 An **XGBoost classifier** trained to detect customer churn
- 🖥️ A **Streamlit web app** for live customer churn predictions
- 💾 Exported model and feature files for reproducibility
- 📹 (Optional) Demo video walkthrough
